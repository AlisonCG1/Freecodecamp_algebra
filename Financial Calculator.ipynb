The term x also has all of these parts: the sign is positive, the coefficient is 1, the variable is x, and the exponent is 1. In the term 5, the sign is positive, the coefficient is 5, the variable is still x, and the exponent is zero (notice that you don't need to write some of these parts, like x0).

You could write that last equation as a logarithm: log<sub>2</sub>16 = x. In Python, you would write this as `math.log(16,2)`. In both cases, you would read it as \"the log, base 2, of 16\" and the answer would be an exponent. The logarithm is especially useful when the exponent is not a nice integer.
