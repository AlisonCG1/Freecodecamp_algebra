The term x also has all of these parts: the sign is positive, the coefficient is 1, the variable is x, and the exponent is 1. In the term 5, the sign is positive, the coefficient is 5, the variable is still x, and the exponent is zero (notice that you don't need to write some of these parts, like x0).
