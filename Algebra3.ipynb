The same is true of Addition and Subtraction: work from left to right and simplify the one the comes up next. Python knows the order of operations.

    "To convert a decimal number to a fraction, let  𝑥  = the number of decimal places. The basic fraction is the number (without the decimal point) over 10 𝑥 . Example: 0.2 =  210  and 0.34 =  34100  and 0.567 =  5671000 . In some cases, you may be able to reduce that fraction. Because \"percent\" means \"out of 100\" the percent refers to the first two decimal places. Complete the code to ask for a decimal input, then print the fraction and the percent. Hint: The exponent variable gives you the number of decimal places."
